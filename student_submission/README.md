# My Submission for Ex0

## What I Did

- Installed GNU Radio Companion
- Created a simple signal test using:
  - `Signal Source` → `QT GUI Frequency Sink`
- Saved the flowgraph as `simple_test_signal.grc`

## File Included

- `simple_test_signal.grc`

## Note

I don’t have an SDR dongle, so I used simulated input instead.
